# Ollama Provider aiohttp Session Leak Fix

## Issue Description
The Ollama provider was creating aiohttp client sessions but not properly closing them, causing resource leaks that could lead to memory issues over time. The error message was:

```
2025-06-05 14:20:02 - asyncio - ERROR - Unclosed client session
client_session: <aiohttp.client.ClientSession object at 0x0000022671C3A990>
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the dynamic model fetching code where aiohttp.ClientSession objects were created but not properly closed in all code paths, particularly in error handling scenarios.

## Files Modified
- `nuke_ai_panel/providers/ollama_provider.py`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Temporary Session Creation Method
```python
async def _create_temp_session(self) -> aiohttp.ClientSession:
    """Create a temporary session for one-time use."""
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    
    # Add API key if provided
    if self.api_key:
        headers['Authorization'] = f'Bearer {self.api_key}'
    
    timeout = aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=self.timeout)
    return aiohttp.ClientSession(
        headers=headers,
        timeout=timeout
    )
```

### 2. Updated Methods to Use Context Managers

#### `get_models()` Method
- **Before**: Sessions were created but not always properly closed in error paths
- **After**: Uses `async with await self._create_temp_session() as session:` for automatic cleanup

#### `authenticate()` Method
- **Before**: Manual session management with finally blocks
- **After**: Uses context manager for guaranteed cleanup

#### `health_check()` Method
- **Before**: Manual session management with finally blocks
- **After**: Uses context manager for guaranteed cleanup

### 3. Proper Resource Management
- All temporary sessions are now automatically closed when exiting the context manager
- Error handling paths no longer leak sessions
- Existing persistent session management (`self._session`) remains intact
- The `__aexit__` method still properly closes persistent sessions

## Key Improvements

1. **Context Manager Usage**: All temporary HTTP operations now use `async with` statements
2. **Automatic Cleanup**: Sessions are automatically closed even when exceptions occur
3. **Resource Isolation**: Temporary sessions are separate from persistent sessions
4. **Error Safety**: All error paths now properly clean up resources
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality remains unchanged

## Testing Results

The fix was verified with a comprehensive test that:
- ✅ Creates provider instances without leaking sessions
- ✅ Handles authentication failures without leaking sessions
- ✅ Handles model fetching without leaking sessions
- ✅ Handles health checks without leaking sessions
- ✅ Properly cleans up in context manager usage

## Impact

- **Memory Usage**: Eliminates session leaks that could accumulate over time
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of HTTP connections
- **Stability**: Prevents potential memory issues during long-running operations
- **Performance**: No impact on existing functionality
- **Compatibility**: Maintains all existing behavior and APIs

## Verification

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_ollama_session_leak_fix.py
```

The test confirms that no "Unclosed client session" errors occur and all resources are properly cleaned up.

## Summary

This fix ensures that the Ollama provider properly manages aiohttp sessions by:
1. Using context managers for automatic resource cleanup
2. Ensuring sessions are closed in all code paths
3. Separating temporary and persistent session management
4. Maintaining backward compatibility while fixing the resource leak

The fix is minimal, focused, and addresses the specific issue without breaking existing functionality.
