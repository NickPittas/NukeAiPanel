# Model Mapping System Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address critical issues with the model mapping system.

## Issues Addressed

1. **OpenRouter Model ID Error**: Fixed invalid model IDs like `google/gemini-pro` by implementing dynamic model discovery and proper mapping
2. **Ollama Fallback Models Not Found**: Added dynamic model discovery for Ollama and improved fallback model selection
3. **Error Handling Improvements**: Enhanced error messages and fallback mechanisms

## Implementation Details

### OpenRouter Provider Fixes

1. **Dynamic Model Discovery**:
   - Added code to fetch and store available model IDs from the OpenRouter API
   - Created a model ID validation and mapping system

2. **Improved Model Mapping**:
   - Implemented the `_validate_and_map_model` method to ensure valid model IDs
   - Added mappings for common models to their OpenRouter equivalents
   - Added fallback to similar models when exact matches aren't found

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Better error messages when models aren't found
   - Graceful fallback to alternative models

### Ollama Provider Fixes

1. **Dynamic Model Discovery**:
   - Added code to fetch and store available models from the local Ollama instance
   - Created a model mapping system that adapts to available models

2. **Improved Fallback Models**:
   - Updated fallback models to include more commonly available options
   - Added `_map_model_to_available` method to find the best available model

3. **Smarter Model Selection**:
   - Implemented partial matching for model names
   - Added prioritized lists of alternative models for common model types

### Provider Manager Fixes

1. **Updated Model Mappings**:
   - Revised the `MODEL_NAME_MAPPING` with more accurate mappings
   - Added new entries for problematic models like `google/gemini-pro`

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Improved error messages with suggestions for available models
   - Better logging of model mapping operations

3. **Fallback Mechanism Improvements**:
   - Updated fallback model lists to use more reliable models
   - Added better error reporting when all fallbacks fail

## Testing

A new test script `test_model_mapping_fixes.py` has been created to verify:
- OpenRouter model mapping works correctly
- Ollama uses available models
- Fallback mechanisms work as expected
- Text generation works with mapped models

## Future Improvements

1. **Caching of Available Models**:
   - Implement persistent caching of available models to reduce API calls

2. **User-Configurable Mappings**:
   - Allow users to define their own model mappings in configuration

3. **Automatic Model Installation**:
   - For Ollama, suggest commands to pull missing models

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Track success rates of different model mappings to improve over time
