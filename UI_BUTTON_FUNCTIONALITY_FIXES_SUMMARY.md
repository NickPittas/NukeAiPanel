# UI Button Functionality Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

This update addresses two critical UI button functionality issues that were preventing full usage of the AI assistant:

1. **Preview Action Button Not Working**
   - Error: `Failed to preview action: name 'QRegExp' is not defined`
   - Root cause: PySide2 to PySide6 migration issue where `QRegExp` needed to be replaced with `QRegularExpression`

2. **Copy Code Button Not Working**
   - Issue: No visual feedback when code was copied
   - Root cause: The `show_copy_feedback` method was empty, providing no user feedback

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Preview Action Button Fix

The issue was fixed by properly implementing the `QRegularExpression` mock class in `action_preview.py`:

- Added the missing `globalMatch` method to the `QRegularExpression` mock class
- This method returns a match iterator with the necessary methods (`hasNext`, `next`)
- The `next` method returns a match object with the required methods (`hasMatch`, `capturedStart`, `capturedLength`)

This fix ensures that the syntax highlighting works correctly when previewing actions, even when running in an environment without PySide6.

### 2. Copy Code Button Fix

The issue was fixed by implementing the `show_copy_feedback` method in `chat_interface.py`:

- Added visual feedback when code is copied to the clipboard
- The button text changes to "Copied!" and the style changes to indicate success
- After 1.5 seconds, the button reverts to its original state
- This provides clear feedback to the user that the copy action was successful

## Testing

The fixes were verified using a direct test script that confirms:

1. The `QRegularExpression` implementation has all required methods and functionality
2. The copy feedback implementation works correctly

All tests passed, indicating that both UI button functionality issues have been resolved.

## Impact

These fixes restore full functionality to the AI assistant UI:

- Users can now preview AI-suggested actions before applying them
- Users can copy code snippets with clear visual feedback
- The application now properly uses PySide6 components instead of PySide2

## Next Steps

While these fixes address the immediate UI button functionality issues, it's recommended to:

1. Perform comprehensive testing in a Nuke environment
2. Consider adding more robust error handling for edge cases
3. Enhance the visual feedback for other UI interactions to improve user experience
