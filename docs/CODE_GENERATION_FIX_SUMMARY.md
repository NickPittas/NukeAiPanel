# Code Generation Consistency Fix

## Issue Summary

The AI panel was experiencing inconsistent code generation behavior across different AI models. Some models were not returning code when requested, or were returning code in inconsistent formats. This issue was affecting the user experience and preventing reliable code generation functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the system, we identified several issues that contributed to the inconsistent code generation:

1. **Lack of Explicit Code Formatting Instructions**: The system prompts did not explicitly instruct AI models to return code in markdown format with proper code blocks.

2. **Inconsistent Provider Handling**: Different AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Ollama) have different default behaviors for formatting code, and the system wasn't accounting for these differences.

3. **Missing Code Block Specifications**: When requesting code, the prompts didn't specify that code should be formatted within triple backtick markdown blocks with language specification.

4. **No Provider-Specific Adaptations**: Some providers (particularly Mistral and Ollama) needed more explicit instructions to consistently format code in markdown blocks.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced System Prompts

Updated all system prompts in `data/prompts/system_prompts.json` to include explicit instructions for code formatting:

```
When providing code, ALWAYS format it within markdown code blocks using triple backticks with the language specified, like this:
```python
# Your code here
import nuke
```
This ensures the code is properly formatted and syntax-highlighted for the user.
```

These instructions were added to all provider-specific prompts (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral) to ensure consistent behavior.

### 2. Updated Output Formats

Enhanced the output format specifications in `data/prompts/system_prompts.json` to explicitly request code in markdown format:

```
"Code": Working Nuke Python script, ALWAYS formatted in a markdown code block using triple backticks with 'python' language specifier like this:
```python
# Your code here
import nuke
# Rest of your code
```
```

### 3. Improved VFX Prompt Engine

Modified the `_get_output_format` method in `src/vfx_knowledge/prompt_engine.py` to include explicit code formatting instructions in all generated prompts.

### 4. Enhanced Message Processing

Updated the `enhance_message_with_knowledge` method in `src/core/panel_manager.py` to add explicit code formatting instructions when code-related keywords are detected in user messages.

### 5. Provider-Specific Handling

Implemented a new `_add_code_formatting_instructions` method in `nuke_ai_panel/core/provider_manager.py` that adds provider-specific code formatting instructions to messages. This method:

- Detects if a message is code-related
- Adds specific formatting instructions for Mistral and Ollama providers
- Modifies system messages or user messages as appropriate for each provider

### 6. Added Testing

Created a new test script `test_code_generation_consistency.py` to verify consistent code generation across different AI providers. This test:

- Tests code generation with multiple providers
- Verifies that code is returned in proper markdown code blocks
- Checks for the presence of expected code elements (like `import nuke`)
- Provides a summary of results to confirm consistent behavior

## Expected Results

With these changes, all AI models should now:

1. Consistently return code in markdown format with proper code blocks
2. Use the `python` language specifier for syntax highlighting
3. Format code in a way that is easily extractable by the UI
4. Maintain consistent behavior across all supported providers

The changes are backward compatible and should not affect other functionality of the AI assistant.

## Verification

Run the test script to verify consistent code generation across providers:

```bash
python test_code_generation_consistency.py
```

This will test each available provider and report whether they correctly return formatted code blocks.
