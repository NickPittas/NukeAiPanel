# Code Generation Test Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mistral Authentication Error

**Problem:**
```
Authentication error for mistral: Authentication failed: Mistral library not properly installed
```

The Mistral provider was failing when the Mistral library wasn't installed, raising an exception instead of gracefully handling the missing dependency.

**Solution:**
- Added proper dependency checking in the `authenticate` method
- Improved error handling to return `False` instead of raising exceptions when the library is missing
- Added clear error messages about missing dependencies
- Added `sys` import for module checking

**Result:**
- The test now gracefully skips Mistral with a clear message when the library is not installed
- No more authentication errors for missing dependencies

### 2. Ollama Timeout Error

**Problem:**
```
API error for 'ollama': Request timed out after 60 seconds
```

The Ollama provider was timing out when using large models like deepseek-coder:33b because the default timeout was insufficient.

**Solution:**
- Implemented model-specific timeout configuration
- Added a longer default timeout (300s) for large models
- Added a helper method `_adjust_timeout_for_model()` to dynamically set timeouts based on model size
- Added detection for large models like deepseek-coder, 33b, 70b variants, etc.

**Result:**
- Successfully tested with deepseek-coder:33b model using the extended timeout (300s)
- The test automatically detects large models and adjusts the timeout accordingly

### 3. Test Script Improvements

**Problem:**
Tests were failing due to infrastructure issues rather than actual code generation problems.

**Solution:**
- Updated test script to use smaller, faster models for testing when available
- Added special handling for Mistral dependency issues
- Added special handling for Ollama timeout errors
- Added explicit timeout configuration for each provider
- Improved error messages with suggestions for fixing issues
- Added automatic model selection for Ollama when the default model is not available

**Result:**
- The test now successfully runs with available models
- Clear error messages and suggestions when issues occur
- Automatic fallback to available models when the default is not found

## Verification Results

The fixes have been verified with a successful test run:

```
Testing provider: ollama
Ollama connection successful at http://localhost:11434
Default model not found, using available model: deepseek-coder:33b
Using model: deepseek-coder:33b
Using extended timeout (300s) for large model: deepseek-coder:33b
Using timeout: 300s for model deepseek-coder:33b

## Testing Recommendations

1. **For Mistral:**
   - Install the Mistral library with: `pip install mistralai`
   - Or the test will gracefully skip Mistral with a clear message

2. **For Ollama:**
   - The test now automatically selects available models if the default is not found
   - Timeout has been increased for large models (300s instead of 60s)
   - For faster tests, install smaller models like llama2: `ollama pull llama2`

## Future Improvements

1. Consider making the Mistral library an optional dependency in the package requirements
2. Add configuration options for model-specific timeouts in the config files
3. Implement progressive timeout scaling based on model size and complexity
4. Add better test skipping for providers with missing dependencies
5. Add a model size detection mechanism to automatically select appropriate models for testing
