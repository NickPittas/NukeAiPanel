# Workflow Functionality Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was experiencing an error when trying to display workflows in the chat interface:

```
Failed to show workflows: 'Workflow' object is not subscriptable
```

## Root Cause
The `Workflow` class in `src/vfx_knowledge/workflow_database.py` is defined as a dataclass with attributes like `name`, `description`, etc. However, in the `show_workflows()` method of the `ChatInterface` class in `src/ui/chat_interface.py`, the code was trying to access these attributes using dictionary-style notation (`workflow['name']`), which is not supported by the `Workflow` class.

Dataclasses in Python are designed to be accessed via attribute notation (e.g., `workflow.name`), not via subscripting (e.g., `workflow['name']`). Since the `Workflow` class doesn't implement the `__getitem__` method, it doesn't support the square bracket notation.

## Fix Applied
Modified the `show_workflows()` method in `src/ui/chat_interface.py` to use attribute access instead of dictionary-style access:

```python
# Before:
for workflow in workflows:
    item = QListWidgetItem(workflow['name'])
    item.setToolTip(workflow.get('description', ''))
    item.setData(Qt.UserRole, workflow)
    workflow_list.addItem(item)

# After:
for workflow in workflows:
    item = QListWidgetItem(workflow.name)
    item.setToolTip(workflow.description)
    item.setData(Qt.UserRole, workflow)
    workflow_list.addItem(item)
```

Also updated the `use_workflow()` method to use attribute access:

```python
# Before:
prompt = f"Please help me with the {workflow['name']} workflow."
if 'description' in workflow:
    prompt += f" {workflow['description']}"

# After:
prompt = f"Please help me with the {workflow.name} workflow."
prompt += f" {workflow.description}"
```

## Verification
Created and ran a test script (`test_workflow_functionality_fix.py`) that verifies:

1. Workflow objects can be accessed via attributes
2. The workflow display functionality works correctly
3. The `PanelManager.get_available_workflows()` method returns properly accessible objects

All tests passed successfully, confirming that the workflow functionality is now working correctly.

## Impact
This fix restores the workflow functionality in the chat interface, allowing users to:
- Browse available VFX workflows
- Select workflows to use in their projects
- Get AI assistance with specific workflows

## Additional Notes
- The fix maintains the original design of using dataclasses for the `Workflow` objects
- No changes were needed to the `Workflow` class itself, as the issue was in how it was being accessed
- The fix is minimal and focused, only changing the necessary code in the chat interface
