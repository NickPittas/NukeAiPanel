# Authentication and Model Compatibility Fixes

This document summarizes the critical fixes implemented to address authentication issues, model compatibility problems, and unclosed client sessions.

## 1. Mistral Authentication Fixes

The Mistral provider authentication has been enhanced with:

- **Robust Retry Logic**: Added a retry mechanism that attempts authentication up to 3 times with a delay between attempts
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error detection and reporting for different failure scenarios
- **Comprehensive Session Cleanup**: Enhanced the `close()` method to properly clean up all resources, including the Mistral client and any associated sessions

Key improvements:
```python
# Added retry logic to authentication
max_retries = 3
retry_delay = 2  # seconds
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        # Create a new client instance for each retry to avoid stale connections
        if attempt > 0:
            logger.info(f"Retrying Mistral authentication (attempt {attempt+1}/{max_retries})")
            self.client = MistralAsyncClient(
                api_key=self.api_key,
                endpoint=self.endpoint
            )
        # ...
```

## 2. Model Name Mapping System

A comprehensive model name mapping system has been implemented in the provider manager to ensure consistent model selection across different providers:

- **Standard Model Mappings**: Created mappings between standard model names (like "gpt-3.5-turbo") and their equivalents across different providers
- **Provider-Specific Mappings**: Added provider-specific model name mappings
- **Fallback Models**: Implemented a fallback mechanism that tries alternative models when the requested model is not found

Key components:
```python
MODEL_NAME_MAPPING = {
    # Standard model names that work across providers
    'standard': {
        'gpt-3.5-turbo': {
            'openai': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
            'openrouter': 'openai/gpt-3.5-turbo',
            'anthropic': 'claude-instant-1.2',
            'mistral': 'mistral-small',
            'ollama': 'llama2',
            'google': 'gemini-pro'
        },
        # ...
    },
    # Provider-specific model mappings
    'mistral': {
        'mistral-tiny': 'mistral-tiny',
        'mistral-small': 'mistral-small',
        # ...
    },
    # ...
}
```

## 3. Enhanced Session Cleanup

The event loop manager has been significantly improved to track and clean up client sessions properly:

- **Detailed Session Tracking**: Added tracking of session creation time, provider, and status
- **Automatic Stale Session Cleanup**: Implemented periodic cleanup of sessions that have been open for too long
- **Provider-Specific Session Identification**: Added provider name to sessions for better tracking and debugging
- **Improved Cleanup Logic**: Enhanced the cleanup process to ensure all sessions are properly closed

Key improvements:
```python
def register_session(session, provider_name=None):
    """
    Register a session with the global event loop manager.
    
    Args:
        session: The session to register
        provider_name: Optional provider name for better tracking
    """
    if provider_name and hasattr(session, '_provider_name'):
        session._provider_name = provider_name
    get_event_loop_manager().register_session(session)
```

## Provider Updates

All providers have been updated to use the enhanced session tracking and cleanup mechanisms:

1. **Mistral Provider**: Improved authentication and session handling
2. **OpenRouter Provider**: Enhanced session tracking with provider identification
3. **Ollama Provider**: Added better session management for both persistent and temporary sessions

## Testing

These fixes should be tested with:

1. **Authentication Test**: Verify Mistral authentication works reliably
2. **Cross-Provider Model Test**: Test using the same model name across different providers
3. **Session Cleanup Test**: Monitor for "Unclosed client session" warnings after operations

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. Expand the model mapping system with more models and providers
2. Add automatic API key validation on startup
3. Implement more sophisticated fallback strategies based on model capabilities
4. Add telemetry to track session lifecycle and identify potential leaks
