# Critical UI Functionality Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Provider Dropdown Not Working
- **Problem**: The provider dropdown was getting stuck on one provider and not updating when selecting other providers
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Configuration changes were not being persisted
  - Signal handling in the UI was causing recursive calls
  - Provider manager was not properly reading from the updated config

- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Added signal blocking to prevent recursive calls in `main_panel.py`
  - Improved config reading in `provider_manager.py` to properly retrieve the current provider
  - Added explicit config saving after provider changes to ensure persistence
  - Enhanced error handling to ensure signals are unblocked even if errors occur

### 2. Connection Tests Hanging
- **Problem**: Connection tests were hanging indefinitely with no feedback
- **Root Cause**:
  - Asyncio operations in threads were not properly managed
  - No timeout mechanism for connection tests
  - UI callbacks were not reliably executed

- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Added explicit timeout handling for connection tests
  - Implemented a watchdog timer to force completion if tests hang
  - Improved error handling in asyncio thread operations
  - Added proper cleanup of asyncio resources
  - Enhanced UI feedback mechanisms

## Files Modified

1. `src/ui/main_panel.py`
   - Enhanced provider change handling with signal blocking
   - Added logging for provider changes
   - Improved error handling

2. `src/ui/settings_dialog.py`
   - Added timeout handling for connection tests
   - Implemented watchdog timer for hanging tests
   - Improved asyncio thread management
   - Enhanced error handling and resource cleanup

3. `nuke_ai_panel/core/provider_manager.py`
   - Fixed config reading mechanism
   - Added explicit config saving
   - Improved provider switching logic
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

## Verification

The fixes have been verified with a comprehensive test script that confirms:
- Provider dropdown now correctly switches between providers
- Connection tests complete successfully with proper timeout handling
- Configuration changes are properly persisted

These fixes ensure that:
1. Users can reliably switch between different AI providers
2. Connection tests provide proper feedback and don't hang
3. UI remains responsive during all operations
4. Provider settings are properly saved and restored

## Additional Improvements

- Added more detailed logging throughout the codebase
- Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Enhanced timeout handling for all async operations
- Added safeguards against UI thread blocking
