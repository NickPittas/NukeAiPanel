# Model Mapping Verification Guide

This guide explains how to verify the fixes made to the model mapping system in the Nuke AI Panel.

## Background

The model mapping system had several critical issues:

1. **OpenRouter Model ID Error**: OpenRouter didn't recognize `google/gemini-pro` as a valid model ID
2. **Ollama Fallback Models Not Found**: None of the fallback models for Ollama were found
3. **Error Handling Issues**: Poor error messages and fallback mechanisms

These issues have been fixed with improvements to the model mapping system, dynamic model discovery, and better error handling.

## Verification Scripts

Three scripts have been created to verify the fixes:

1. **test_model_mapping_fixes.py**: Tests the basic functionality of the model mapping system
2. **verify_model_mapping_fixes.py**: Verifies specific provider/model combinations
3. **run_model_mapping_tests.py**: Runs all tests and generates a comprehensive report

## How to Verify the Fixes

### Option 1: Run All Tests

To run all tests and generate a comprehensive report:

```bash
python run_model_mapping_tests.py
```

This will:
- Run the main test script
- Test specific provider/model combinations
- Generate a report showing which tests passed and failed

### Option 2: Test Specific Provider/Model Combinations

To test a specific provider and model:

```bash
python verify_model_mapping_fixes.py --provider openrouter --model gpt-3.5-turbo
```

Available options:
- `--provider`: The provider to test (e.g., openrouter, ollama)
- `--model`: The model to test (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, mistral)
- `--verbose`: Show more detailed output
- `--list-providers`: List all available providers

### Option 3: Run Basic Tests

To run basic tests of the model mapping system:

```bash
python test_model_mapping_fixes.py
```

## What to Look For

### For OpenRouter

1. **Valid Model IDs**: The system should map standard model names to valid OpenRouter model IDs
   - Example: `gpt-3.5-turbo` → `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo`
   - Example: `google/gemini-pro` → `anthropic/claude-3-haiku` (fallback)

2. **Dynamic Discovery**: The system should discover available models from the OpenRouter API

### For Ollama

1. **Available Models**: The system should map to models that actually exist on your system
   - Example: If `llama2:70b` isn't available, it might map to `llama2:13b` or `llama2`

2. **Dynamic Discovery**: The system should discover which models are actually installed

### Error Handling

1. **Better Error Messages**: When a model isn't found, the error message should be helpful
2. **Fallback Suggestions**: The system should suggest alternative models

## Troubleshooting

If verification fails:

1. **Check Authentication**: Ensure your API keys are correctly configured
2. **Check Ollama Installation**: For Ollama tests, ensure Ollama is running
3. **Check Available Models**: Run `verify_model_mapping_fixes.py --provider ollama --list-providers` to see available providers
4. **Check Logs**: Look for detailed error messages in the logs

## Summary of Changes

The following files were modified to fix the model mapping issues:

1. **nuke_ai_panel/providers/openrouter_provider.py**:
   - Added dynamic model discovery
   - Implemented model validation and mapping

2. **nuke_ai_panel/providers/ollama_provider.py**:
   - Added dynamic model discovery
   - Implemented mapping to available models

3. **nuke_ai_panel/core/provider_manager.py**:
   - Updated model mappings
   - Improved error handling
   - Enhanced fallback mechanisms
